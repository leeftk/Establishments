#Establishments 

(Verse 1)
yea
My pockets full of virtues
Ive been living off of these verses
Packing backpacks with my fears 
As I rocket across oceans
Must I leave this place I love so much
Politicians that I cannot trust
All just run amok looking for rich donors to fund them up
Fucking our system after they say they are celibate
Spend a few more dollars now they get a few more delegates
Fuck a bailout for the one percent
They stole and sold our votes, who do they really represent?

(Chorus?)
But I don't think they care for y'all (x2)
Drop that ballot in the bin
Just so that they win (or, just to get a pin?)

But I don't think they care for y'all (x2)
I think my voting is a sin
It's all dust in the wind

But I don't think they care for y'all (x2)
Does the fight begin?
Does it even matter in the end?

Cause I don't really care no more, I don't really care no more

(Verse 2)
Spending money from the people 
Getting rich is what they represent 
All this starts to make some sense
Our government is fullshit
Taking money from the people 
Giving back to the establishment 
I don’t think that we having it (x2)
We came here for our freedom
So best believe we getting that again
I never promised loyalty to those I wouldn’t fight for them 
why would I believe that we’d be safe from the establishment (establishment)
Thinking of the places that we could leave, we wasn't having it
Thinking of the places that we could live in peace (yea I know) 
Wanna be free and wanna live happily with glee  (yea I know)
Know that the pursuit of happiness is an inalienable right 
One that was given to me without the need for fight

But i been fighting all my life so im a keep it real tight
